Lesson Overview
===============

This week, let's switch gears a little and talk about
everyone's favorite topic, typesetting! We will explore using
Latex to create beautiful, self-consistent, documents
that are publication quality.

Specifically, you will learn about:

  .. 1. :doc:`python input and output <input>`
  .. 2. :doc:`numerical differentiation <derivatives>`
  .. 3. numerical integration

Learning Goals
--------------

After this week you should be able to:

  - use a Taylor series to develop a numerical differentiation scheme.
  - understand the consequences of truncation error.
  - understand the difference between first and second order numerical schemes.
  - implement a numerical differentiation scheme.
  - implement a numerical integration scheme.
  - read from and write to a file from within python.
