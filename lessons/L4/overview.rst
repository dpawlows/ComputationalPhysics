Lesson Overview
===============

This week, we cover a few different topics. We will
continue to enhance our linux command toolbox while also
digging in a bit deeper into shell scripting. Then,
we will start to learn about techniques for solving
algebraic equations using a computer.

Specifically, you will learn about:

1. :doc:`more linux commands! <commands>`
2. :doc:`more shell scripting! <scrips>`
3. :doc:`root finding techniques <roots>`

Learning Goals
--------------

After this week you should be able to:

  - really know how to do some cool things in Linux.
  - write bash scripts that can actually be useful.
  - solve some basic algebraic equations numerically.
  - discuss topics that are important to numerical methods such as
  round-off error, stopping criteria, iteration, and how numbers are
  stored on a computer.
