Lesson Overview
===============

This week, we will learn how to do some calculus
using a computer! Perhaps more importantly, you
will how certain numerical schemes are developed
so that you will be able to develop your own!
Additionally, we will talk about the syntax behind
reading data into python using some basic functions.

Specifically, you will learn about:

  1. :doc:`python input and output <input>`
  2. :doc:`numerical differentiation <derivatives>`
  3. numerical integration

Learning Goals
--------------

After this week you should be able to:

  - use a Taylor series to develop a numerical differentiation scheme.
  - understand the consequences of truncation error.
  - understand the difference between first and second order numerical schemes.
  - implement a numerical differentiation scheme.
  - implement a numerical integration scheme.
  - read from and write to a file from within python.
