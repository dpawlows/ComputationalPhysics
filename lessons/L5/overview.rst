Lesson Overview
===============

This week, we will learn how to do some calculus
using a computer! Perhaps more importantly, you
will how certain numerical schemes are developed
so that you will be able to develop your own!

Specifically, you will learn about:

  1. :doc:`numerical differentiation <derivatives>`
  2. numerical integration

Learning Goals
--------------

After this week you should be able to:

  - use a Taylor series to develop a numerical differentiation scheme.
  - understand the consequences of truncation error.
  - understand the difference between first and second order numerical schemes.
  - implement a numerical differentiation scheme.
  - implement a numerical integration scheme.
