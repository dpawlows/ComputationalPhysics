Lesson Overview
===============

Back to numerics! Our goal this week is to solve ordinary
differential equations using a computer! So, we will look
at a few techniques for doing just that.

Learning Goals
--------------

After this week you should be able to:

  - understand the development of algorithms behind several different ODE solvers.
  - tell the difference between the Euler method and Runge-Kutta schemes.
  - implement a variety of ODE solvers.
  - describe why one type of solver might be unstable.
